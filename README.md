# [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique)

The pomodoro technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s.
It uses a kitchen timer to break work into intervals, typically 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro
## Usage
The original technique has six steps: 

    1. Decide on the task to be done.
    2. Set the pomodoro timer (typically for 25 minutes).
    3. Work on the task.
    4. End work when the timer rings and take a short break (typically 5–10 minutes).
    5. If you have finished fewer than three pomodoros, go back to Step 2 and repeat until you go through all three pomodoros.
    6. After three pomodoros are done, take the fourth pomodoro and then take a long break (typically 20 to 30 minutes). 
    Once the long break is finished, return to step 2.

For the purposes of the technique, a pomodoro is an interval of work time.

Regular breaks are taken, aiding assimilation. A 10-minute break separates consecutive pomodoros. Four pomodoros form a set. There is a longer 20–30 minute break between sets.

## Purpose of Pomodoro Technique

A goal of the technique is to reduce the effect of internal and external interruptions 
on focus and flow. A pomodoro is indivisible; when interrupted during a pomodoro, either the other activity 
must be recorded and postponed (using the inform – negotiate – schedule – call back strategy) or the pomodoro must be abandoned.
